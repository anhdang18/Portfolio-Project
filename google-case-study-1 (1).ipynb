    "# **Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station andreturned to any other station in the system anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial analysts in the company concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders and advise top management to invest in a marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members through subscription. As a result, the marketing analysts need to better understand rider needs and trends from Cyclistic historical bike trip data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the phases of Data Analysis i.e. Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze to advise whether the investment in the marketing strategy would be a good decision.\n",
    "### 1. Ask \n",
    "#### What problem is being solved?\n",
    "The business task at hand is to find out whether this marketing strategy is worth investing in. To get started, an analysis of the difference in usage of Cyclistic bikes between annual members and casual riders needs to be done.\n",
    "### Consider key stakeholders \n",
    "The key stakeholders are:\n",
    "* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n",
    "* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n",
    "* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n",
    "* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the\n",
    "recommended marketing program.\n",
