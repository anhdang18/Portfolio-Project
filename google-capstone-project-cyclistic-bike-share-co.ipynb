    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station andreturned to any other station in the system anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial analysts in the company concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders and advise top management to invest in a marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members through subscription. As a result, the marketing analysts need to better understand rider needs and trends from Cyclistic historical bike trip data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through the phases of Data Analysis i.e. Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze,Share and Act to advise whether the investment in the marketing strategy would be a good decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Ask - What problem is being solved?**\n",
    "The business task at hand is to find out whether this marketing strategy is worth investing in. To get started, an analysis of the difference in usage of Cyclistic bikes between annual members and casual riders needs to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Prepare** - The data used for this analysis was obtained from a public dataset stored within the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The link is provided below:\n",
    "[Cyclistic Ride Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n",
    "12-month data (from June 2020 to May 2021) was used to carry out the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the preparation of data, the following is done:\n",
    "* the various datasets are imported to R\n",
    "* the structure of the datasets are analyzed to ensure consistency \n"
